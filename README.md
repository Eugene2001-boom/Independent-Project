* You need to have a device that can access the internet
* You need to have internet connection
* You should click the URL to navigate into the Portforlio
* The links should take you to the projects that i did                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
This Portforlio needs a browser where you will type the URL in it and run the commands where the URL will take to the Portforlio
The page does not carry much information since it is my first Portforlio.The Portforlio only meets the required code writing languages 
*There are no complex technologies used
